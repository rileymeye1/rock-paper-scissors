# rock-paper-scissors
Rock, Paper, Scissors JavaScript practice from The Odin Project (TOP).

This project was to create the old school game of Rock, Paper, Scissors using JavaScript. Version 1 will only play in the Developer
Console and I will come back to this project later to add a nicer User Interface for the player.
